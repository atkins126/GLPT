## Usage
Using GLPT is easy, you only need to include the GLPT unit and create a window. Then run the event loop and do all your application stuff there. There are numerous examples included to help you to make a jump start.

    uses
      GLPT;
  
      ...

      GLPT_Init
      window := GLPT_CreateWindow(0, 0, width, height, 'Simple example');

      while not GLPT_WindowShouldClose(window) do
      begin
        //do your OpenGL magic here

        GLPT_SwapBuffers(window);
        GLPT_PollEvents;
      end;

      GLPT_Terminate;
